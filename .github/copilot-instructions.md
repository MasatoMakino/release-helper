## TypeScript

- Add instructions to include the .js extension in import paths for TypeScript using ESM.

## Unit tests

- Use **Vitest** as the test framework.
- Do **not** use **Jest** or any other testing frameworks.
- Place unit tests under the `__test__` directory, with the same name as the target file and a `spec.ts` extension.
